Often, projects are launched without a clear rationale, measurable objectives, or structured plans, making it difficult to assess whether we are on the right track or even why we are undertaking the work in the first place. This gap between idea crafting and actual execution is what initially sparked my interest in pursuing a more structured, analytical, and impactful approach to solving business problems. During my time at Evermos as a Project Management Officer and Business Operational Analyst, I was fortunate to experience a turning point. I discovered a strong passion for crafting business strategies, developing impactful initiatives, and ensuring alignment with key performance metrics and goals. I began to truly enjoy the process of turning ideas into executable plans and seeing them generate real outcomes. Through this role, I developed the ability to conduct comprehensive project assessments and construct project charters, clearly defining the background, setting objectives, and determining what needs to be done, why it matters, and who should be involved. I also learned to develop structured project roadmaps. However, one key skill I am eager to deepen is client management. As someone who understands the internal dynamics of project execution, I realize that aligning project design with client needs and expectations is just as critical as the internal strategy. The ability to listen, engage, and build trust with clients is something I value and am motivated to master. Joining Skha’s 12-month program is more than a step forward. it’s a leap toward my career goal of becoming a strategic problem-solver and impactful consultant. I am especially drawn to the program’s emphasis on real-world project exposure, rigorous training, and structured mentorship, which I believe are essential in refining both my analytical skills and my ability to manage and serve clients effectively. I’m fully committed and motivated to contribute meaningfully, learn relentlessly, and grow into a consultant who doesn’t just solve problems, but builds clarity, strategy, and impact in every engagement.",Yes,https://skha.co.id/wp-content/uploads/forminator/3202_484234451e02186ede58eeb382c0fc59/uploads/XtermowC9Zzm-CV-Fahmi-Nabil-Ramadhani.pdf,https://skha.co.id/wp-content/uploads/forminator/3202_484234451e02186ede58eeb382c0fc59/uploads/6kK9RcUhL1EK-Transkrip_Fahmi-Nabil-Ramadhani-2.pdf,Skha Graduate Development Program,"2:35:10 pm, GMT+0700",06/05/2025

During my time at university, I developed a strong academic foundation in consumer behavior, business strategy, and data-driven marketing. My thesis, which analyzes the interplay between customer experience, price perception, and repurchase intention, using customer loyalty as a mediating variable, has deepened my understanding of how analytical insights can drive impactful business decisions. Beyond academics, I have gained practical experience through my role at PT Brodo Ganesha Indonesia, where I created content for Instagram Stories, managed collaborations with influencers, and developed content briefs to support new product launches. These experiences have equipped me with the ability to think both creatively and strategically, two qualities I believe are essential in a consultant. What excites me most about SKHA is its strong reputation in strategic business advisory and its commitment to developing future leaders through hands-on exposure, structured learning, and a high-performance culture.

The emphasis on empowering employees to ""grow and thrive,"" regardless of their aspirations to become a leading expert or a global leader, resonates deeply with my own professional ambitions and personal values. This dedication to cultivating talent, rather than simply utilizing it, signals a forward-thinking organization where continuous learning and development are not just encouraged but are foundational to its success. Furthermore, Skha's conviction that the company's accomplishments are a direct reflection of each employee's self-development journey speaks volumes about its investment in its people. I firmly believe that a supportive and growth-oriented workplace is crucial for individuals to reach their full potential and, in turn, contribute meaningfully to the organization's objectives. The prospect of joining a team that recognizes and actively supports this symbiotic relationship between personal progress and company success is incredibly appealing. Beyond the focus on development, Skha's clearly defined core values provide a compelling framework for its culture and operations. The seven principles – from a ""Proactive Spirit"" and striving for continuous improvement to upholding ""Fairness and Integrity"" and fostering ""Teamwork and Togetherness"" – paint a picture of a company that values not only competence but also ethical conduct, collaboration, and a genuine sense of community. The emphasis on treating colleagues as ""family"" and prioritizing ""Respect & Caring"" suggests a human-centered approach that extends beyond mere professional interactions. These values align strongly with my own belief in the importance of a positive, ethical, and collaborative work environment where every individual feels valued and respected.",Yes,https://skha.co.id/wp-content/uploads/forminator/3202_484234451e02186ede58eeb382c0fc59/uploads/5wE8zVCG653i-Resume_Razig-Dante-Gunawan.pdf,https://skha.co.id/wp-content/uploads/forminator/3202_484234451e02186ede58eeb382c0fc59/uploads/VLeLd6Jwq60N-Transkrip-Nilai-Razig-Dante-Gunawan.pdf,Skha Graduate Development Program,"4:15:00 pm, GMT+0700",06/05/2025

With a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Bandung Institute of Technology, hands-on engineering experience, and a strong leadership background, I am eager to contribute meaningfully to SKHA’s mission of delivering impactful consulting solutions. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a deep understanding of mechanical systems, particularly in the field of energy. My internship at PT. Mobar Sarana Energi, where I designed and analyzed a bike manipulator for PT. Astra Honda Motor equipped me with practical experience in engineering design, problem-solving, and project execution under real world constraints. In parallel with my academic and technical pursuits, I served as President of the Student Society of Mechanical Engineering at ITB, leading over 600 members to support their academic welfare and professional development. This role sharpened my leadership, stakeholder management, and communication skills capabilities that align closely with the responsibilities of a consultant at SKHA. Coordinating large scale initiatives and engaging with diverse stakeholders has made me adept at navigating complex challenges, building consensus, and delivering results. The SGDP’s promise of structured training, mentorship, and real world consulting experience strongly appeals to me. I am especially drawn to the program’s emphasis on analytical rigor, client engagement, and presentation development areas where I am eager to grow further. My GPA of 3.22 reflects my ability to balance academic excellence with professional and organizational responsibilities. SKHA’s dynamic and collaborative culture resonates deeply with my career aspirations. I would be honored to begin my consulting journey through SGDP and contribute to impactful client outcomes from the outset. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my technical background, leadership experience, and drive to grow align with the goals of SGDP and SKHA Consulting.
